# x264-64 CPU Stability Test Script v3.00 BETA 

## Overview

This script leverages the x264-64 tool to perform a CPU stability test, simulating different workloads by varying the number of threads involved in the processing. It has been designed to work in a Windows environment using Python 3.11.

This is the spiritual successor to the Overclock.net community batch script [Which Originally appeared in the Haswell Overclocking guide nearly a decade ago!](https://www.overclock.net/threads/haswell-overclocking-guide-with-statistics.1411077/page-737#post-22689780)

## üöÄ Features

### **Preset Thread Allocation for Stress Testing**

The script performs stress tests using pre-defined thread allocations to emulate different workload conditions. Here are the different scenarios tested:

#### 1. Maximum Threads
- **Loops**: 10 
- **Threads Used**: `max_threads`, as specified by the user
- **Description**: 
  Utilizes the full number of threads specified by the user, aiming to test the CPU's capacity under heavy multithreaded workloads.

#### 2. Half Threads
- **Loops**: 10
- **Threads Used**: `max_threads // 2`
- **Description**:
  Employs half of the specified maximum threads (rounded down) to simulate moderately multithreaded workloads.

#### 3. Quarter Threads
- **Loops**: 10
- **Threads Used**: `max_threads // 4`
- **Description**:
  Engages a quarter of the maximum threads (rounded down) for testing under lighter multithreaded conditions.

#### 4. Minimal Threads
- **Loops**: 20
- **Threads Used**: 2
- **Description**:
  In the final stage, a minimal setup using 2 threads is engaged to scrutinize the stability under minimal multithreaded conditions.
  
### Script Workflow

Each scenario presents a different level of stress on the CPU, aiming to ensure stability under various potential workloads.

### **Detailed Logging**

Each test iteration logs detailed reports into a specified log file, capturing both standard output and errors during execution to facilitate a comprehensive review post testing.

### **Automatic File Cleanup**

Upon completion of the test, the script automatically removes all temporary files created during the test process, maintaining a clean working environment.

### **Interactive Input**

Users are guided through the setup process with intuitive prompts to specify critical inputs such as maximum thread count and log file naming, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

### **Version Display**

At initiation, the script displays the x264-64 tool version, providing users with a quick reference to the tool‚Äôs version in use.

## üõ† Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows OS
- x264-64 tool ensure it's named `x264-64.exe` and in the `test` directory
- Test video file (`test-1080p.mp4`) available in the `test` directory

## üì• Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Download it from the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the latest x264-64 tool and ensure it's named `x264-64.exe` and placed in the `test` directory, adjacent to the script. [VideoLAN x264 Binaries](https://artifacts.videolan.org/x264/)
3. Place a ~2 minute video file named `test-1080p.mp4` in the `test` directory, adjacent to the script.
4. Clone or download the script to your local system.

Ensure your directory structure looks like this:

üìÇ **x264_stability_test/**
> üìù **README.md** - Your guide to using and contributing to the project.
> üêç **x264_stability_test.py** - The main script to perform CPU stress tests.
> üìÅ **test/**
>> üé¨ **test-1080p.mp4** - Video file used during the testing process.
>> üñ•Ô∏è **x264-64.exe** - Executable necessary to conduct the stability tests.

## üöÄ Usage

To execute the script, run the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```
python3 x264_stability_test.py

```

## :older_man: It may be wise to use a number larger than the maximum thread count for your CPU. 

- You may benefit from an increase of 33%-50% in maxium thread allocation vs the number of threads available on your system. As an example, I saw >5% CPU utilization growth from 24 to 32 cores on my 7900X3D. 
- *New BETA 2 version, it's better to have 400% as I work to make the script more heavily workload dynamic.*


## Configuration File

To tailor the stability test to specific needs and preferences, a configuration file in JSON format has been introduced in this version. This file allows users to configure various settings including loop and thread counts, enhancing the flexibility and customization of the stress tests.

Here's how it works:

### **Creating and Modifying the Configuration File**
- **Location**: Ensure that the configuration file is located in the root directory of the script.
- **Format**: The configuration file must adhere to a valid JSON format. 
- **Parameters**: Define key parameters such as `max_threads`, `loops`, among others to suit your testing requisites.
- **Error Handling**: The script is designed to gracefully handle errors by notifying the user and automatically deleting incorrectly formatted configuration files, maintaining a seamless user experience.

### **Sample Configuration**
```
{
    "max_threads": 32,
    "loops": 10,
    "thread_allocations": {
        "maximum": 32,
        "half": 16,
        "quarter": 8,
        "minimal": 2
    }
}
```
In the above sample, various thread allocations are defined to represent different testing scenarios. Modify these values as per your CPU capabilities and testing goals.

**Notes**
Backup: Before making substantial changes, it is recommended to keep a backup of your configuration file to prevent data loss from inadvertent errors.
Documentation: Refer to the script's documentation to understand the range and acceptable values for each parameter, helping in crafting a configuration that aligns with your objectives.
Leverage the configuration file to fine-tune your stability tests, achieving a balance between rigor and resource allocation, and obtaining results that are most pertinent to your setup.
